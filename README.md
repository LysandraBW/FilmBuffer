I created the UI and integrated the back and front-ends. As this requires the database the team created, a lot of the functionality would not work on your end. So, I will provide screenshots of how the page looks like with full functionality, and how the page looks like with limited functionality. You could access the page that has limited functionality (/query/0).

**Limited Functionality:** 

The data is random. The images are loaded via TMDB. If you want the images to load as well, you'll need to insert an API key.

**Full Functionality:** 

The trends are computed from the data in the DB. You can see the trends in the process.js files. The card images are still loaded from the TMDB API. Moreover, I've created a search input that loads values from the database. The user will be able to search through these values to select one or more values. Finally, when you click a trend, the movie or actor corresponding to that trend (or point) is loaded to the right of the graph.

**Summary**

I did not take as many pictures as I should have, but the full functionality was there! Even if only for a mere second. This was my first time using NextJS, and I had an awesome time. I'd definitely use it again.
