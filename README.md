I worked on this with a group. I focused on the UI and integrating the back and front-ends. As this requires the database my team and I created, a lot of the functionality would not work on your end. I will provide screenshots of how the page looks like with full functionality, and how the page looks like with limited functionality (/query/0).

Limited Functionality:
The data is random. The images are loaded via TMDB.

Full Functionality:
We compute the trends from the database, the images are still loaded via TMDB. The search bar loads values from the database. There is minimal input validation. When you click a trend, the movie or actor corresponding to that trend (or point) is loaded to the right of the graph.

I did not take as many pictures as I should have, but the full functionality was there! Even if it were for a mere second. I had fun working with my teammates, they were all great people. I'm not sure what I should put in a README.md. Definitely learned a lot. Please keep in mind that a lot of this code was rushed. Goodbye!
